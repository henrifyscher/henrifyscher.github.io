# About Me
What are the newest advancements in tech?<br>
And what does that mean for the market and its participants?<br>
Those were the questions trapped in my head since high school and they are the ones driving me everyday.<br>
Hi there, I am Henry, and inspired by those questions, I decided to leave my lovely hometown in the Hunsrück region to study and work in tech. Growing up in a rural area, I suddenly felt a new kind of freedom when I was able to drive a car. It is this feeling that pushed me into researching and working on Automated Driving, a field that holds the promise of independent mobility for those that can not drive a car themselves (yet).

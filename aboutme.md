# 👋 About Me

What are the newest advancements in tech?  
And what does that mean for the market and its participants?  
Those questions have fascinated me since high school and continue to drive me today.

Hi, I’m Henry. Inspired by these questions, I left my lovely hometown in the Hunsrück region to study and work in tech. Growing up in a rural area, I felt a new kind of freedom when I first drove a car. That feeling led me to work on Automated Driving — enabling independent mobility for everyone.
